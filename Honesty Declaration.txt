Honesty Declaration for Individual Work


I, the undersigned, declare that the attached assignment is wholly the 

product of my own work, and that no part of it has been:

  - copied by manual or electronic means from any work produced by any 

    other person(s), present or past, including tutors or tutoring services,

  - based on laboratory work that I did not complete due to unexcused 

    absence(s),

  - produced by several students working together as a team (this includes 

    one person who provides any portion of an assignment to another student

    or students),

  - copied from any other source including textbooks and web sites, or

  - modified to contain falsified data, except as directly authorized by 

    the Instructor.


I understand that penalties for submitting work which is not wholly my own, 

or distributing my work to other students is considered an act of Academic 

Dishonesty and is subject to penalty as described by the University of 

Manitoba's Student Discipline Bylaw*.
